## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance gender diversity and inclusion at the executive management level within a telecom client's organization. Despite ongoing efforts, there has been limited progress in achieving a balanced representation of men and women in leadership roles. The project focuses on analyzing key areas such as hiring practices, promotions, time in grade, performance ratings, age group distribution, and executive gender balance to identify areas for improvement and implement targeted strategies.

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Hiring Practices Analysis:** Evaluate the gender distribution of new hires to identify any biases in recruitment processes and implement strategies to attract more female candidates.

2. **Promotions Analysis:** Analyze the percentage of promotions awarded to men and women to ensure equal opportunities for career advancement.

3. **Time in Grade Analysis:** Assess the average time in grade for employees promoted in the current fiscal year to identify any disparities between genders.

4. **Performance Rating Comparison:** Compare the average performance ratings of employees who have left the organization with those who are still employed, focusing on gender differences.

5. **Age Group Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of employees by age group to understand the impact of age on gender diversity and inclusion initiatives.

6. **Executive Gender Balance:** Evaluate the gender distribution at the executive management level to identify areas for improvement in gender diversity and inclusion efforts.



## Conclusion

By focusing on these key areas and implementing data-driven strategies, the project aims to drive meaningful change and create a more inclusive and diverse executive management team within the telecom client's organization.
